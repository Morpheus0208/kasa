// This configuration extends the conventional commit message format.
// It ensures that commit messages follow a standard format, which is useful for automation and consistency in version control.
// The '@commitlint/config-conventional' package provides a set of rules that enforce this format.
// You can customize the rules further by adding a 'rules' section if needed.
